* Environment Preferences

I prefer working in Org mode with these features:
- Use Babel for code execution
- Enable :tangle for code export
- Always use :mkdirp yes for directory creation
- Create Mermaid diagrams for system/design modeling

* Git Workflow

When committing changes:
- Use conventional commit messages (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- Format commit messages as: ~<type>(<scope>): <description>~
- Always use --no-gpg-sign
- Add trailers for co-authored-by and reviewed-by
- No "Generated by" comments in commit messages

* Emacs Configuration

- Locally installed Emacs 31.0.50 with GTK3 and X11 support
- Audio support via ALSA
- WebDAV/XML support enabled
- Mail utilities configured

* Development Preferences

- Python is my primary language
- Run Emacs with X11 forwarding when using SSH
- Code organization should follow a modular approach
- Document code thoroughly with docstrings

* System Information

- Running on Raspberry Pi (aarch64)
- Linux kernel: 6.12.20+rpt-rpi-v8
